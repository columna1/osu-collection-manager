# osu-collection-manager
A small, lightweight tool to help manage osu! collections

Only a small ammount of error checking has been implemented at the moment, expect bugs, but at the very least you shouldn't lose any files. Everything is backed up into "osu/collections backup" before any changes are made.



Possible future features:
More error checking<br>
Actual release<br>
Sound preview<br>
Ability to add songs into collections<br>
Delete whole collections at a time<br>
Create collections<br>
Move songs between collections<br>
